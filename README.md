# SoftJournal Backend 

This App was my final project for Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
Modeled with a Ruby backend, Reactjs Frontend, PostgresSQL as the database, and Cloundonary as the image API, for hosting images. 

To set up the backend type in "bundle install" then rails db:create, migrate, & seed. 

Non stadared Ruby on Rails gems included active_model_serializers, cloudinary, & jwt.

This app features full user password authencations and all CRUD actions.
